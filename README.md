cluster reviews.

The given data set is populated by capturing user ratings from Google reviews. 
Reviews on attractions from 24 categories across Europe are considered. 
Google user rating ranges from 1 to 5 and the average user rating per 
category is calculated.

Scope:
● Analyzing the existing data and getting valuable insights about the 
review pattern
● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
● Cluster the reviews based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’) 
with the help of dendrogram
